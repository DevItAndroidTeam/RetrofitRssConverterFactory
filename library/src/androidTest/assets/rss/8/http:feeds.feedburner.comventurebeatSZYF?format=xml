Although he is no longer connected with Apple, he keeps busy making appearances at big tech conferences to inspire <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/13/apple-steve-wozniak-watch-jobs-marijuana/">inventors</a>, serves as chief scientist for the enterprise data storage startup <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/11/19/primary-data-brings-woz-aboard-and-talks-virtualized-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primary Data</a>, and even found time to cha-cha-cha on the TV show <em>Dancing With The Stars</em> a few years ago.</p><p>On Friday, Wozniak returns to the upcoming Silicon Valley Comic Con event where pop culture fans, celebrities, and technologists will celebrate &#8220;the nerd side of things,&#8221; as he put it. In this edited interview with <em>Fortune, </em>Wozniak discusses how his former company is acting like Microsoft, the influence of money in Silicon Valley, and being an introvert in the social networking era.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong><em>Fortune</em>: How has the tech landscape changed over the years?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">Wozniak: When Steve and I started Apple we were so naïve and young. We didn&#8217;t know anything about business. We didn&#8217;t know that it’s often the case that you start a company and then you get bought out as an exit strategy. We thought that you start at home, you make a product, and become profitable so you have your company forever. As long as it makes a profit, it never goes away. That&#8217;s how I thought companies worked. Boy, it&#8217;s a different story now in Silicon Valley.</p><p>I think there are an awful lot of people who have a quick exit plan like selling the business to another big company to get enough money to buy a house in San Francisco. Then they move on to the next one. There are many companies that are started by business people and not engineers. Engineers say, “What would be a cool product? What would make the world greater and better?” That&#8217;s where I come from.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>Engineering is your line of work.</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">I do not invest. I don&#8217;t do that stuff. I didn&#8217;t want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>What are your thoughts on the rise of engineers as rock stars in Silicon Valley?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">Mostly it&#8217;s because of how much money they have—and I went the other way. I did not want to be one of them. I invested early in things like museums in the city I love, San Jose. I was born there, and I have a street named after me there because of it. I really didn&#8217;t want to be in that super “more than you could ever need” category.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>Did you ever think when you were starting Apple that software companies like Facebook would become so dominant?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">Well, there was <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>. I was just on <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/17/full-interview-with-steve-wozniak-on-apples-self-driving-cars-silicon-valley-comic-con.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> and they were asking, &#8220;Oh, my gosh. Apple wants to make this software and license it for self-driving cars.&#8221; Well, Apple&#8217;s becoming Microsoft. Microsoft had an operating system that was their crown jewel and they licensed it to everybody. Apple said no—they had to make the hardware. Hardware and software have to go together [in computers], but not so in cars.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>What is your take on commercial space travel and people like <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazoncom-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk getting involved?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">Nobody expected the iPhone. Nobody expected <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/alphabet-36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>. Nobody expected Facebook and Twitter would be these great things. It is really hard to predict with a spreadsheet what makes sense, otherwise big companies that already existed would have created those things. Of course SpaceX [Musk&#8217;s space startup] and Blue Origin [Bezos&#8217; space startup], they&#8217;re not coming out of nowhere, but they&#8217;re coming out of individuals trying to do something very risky.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>It is very risky, but it is fascinating to watch what these companies are doing.</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">Yeah, space exploration comes down to engineering and scientific knowledge. It does take a certain amount of funding, but NASA&#8217;s budget seems so small for what they bring us. It just seems so small that I&#8217;m not surprised that large private players can make a difference too.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>You recently said that companies like Apple and Google would be even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/04/16/steve-wozniak-sees-bigger-apple-google-facebook-2075/100172690/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bigger</a> in 2075 than they are now. Do you think these companies will do so by expanding into other areas, like how Google and Apple are <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/19/alphabet-verily-project-baseline/">moving</a> into <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/21/apple-medical-doctor/">healthcare</a>?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">I don&#8217;t know. Every company should do what they&#8217;re good at. There are actors who are just good at acting. Everyone shouldn&#8217;t try to do every single thing in the world, and Apple&#8217;s big thing, really, is more about protecting the brand. Making products a certain way that protects your brand. That&#8217;s one role. That’s one key role in the world, and it doesn&#8217;t mean making every single product. Everyone who owns Apple shares just says, &#8220;No, no, no, you gotta have something new now.&#8221; Well that’s Silicon Valley in that you’re always chasing the next new thing and you never get to stop. I mean unless you&#8217;re somewhat smart.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>Why is your Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feed</a> essentially a timeline of places you’ve visited and restaurants you’ve eaten at?</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">I am not the right person for social networks. I was never social in my life. I am not good at socializing in person.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">I skipped Facebook and I skipped Twitter when it came out, because I’d wind up with everybody asking me to be a friend. I have 5,000 Facebook friends I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m going to scan what they&#8217;re doing in their lives everyday? It doesn&#8217;t work well for me because I won&#8217;t just cut it down to the only 100 people I really know.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">But I found Foursquare. I was actually in Spain and some young kids introduced me to Foursquare, so I started checking in. I thought, “My wife will be able to see where I am.” But if I check into a restaurant and somebody comments on it, I get that comment in an email from Facebook. So I typically have 100 to 200 Facebook inquires a day, and some of those I go in and answer when I feel my answer&#8217;s important.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>It’s interesting that you prefer Foursquare over other social networks.</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">It&#8217;s kind of one directional, and Twitter can be one-directional. To tell you the truth, I admire what Twitter is and what it&#8217;s done for the world. And I admire Facebook, but I&#8217;m a little scared of the power Facebook and Google get and I avoid them more than most people. My calendar is on Google and about nothing else of me wants to touch Google. When I get these advertisements all over the place and they&#8217;re exactly what I&#8217;ve been looking at recently, you&#8217;re living in my world. You&#8217;re making it stale. That&#8217;s not the adventurous world of going and watching a new movie with superheroes achieving victory.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4"><strong>Well, that&#8217;s a realistic application of artificial intelligence today.</strong></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 end text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4">That&#8217;s today&#8217;s level of simulated intelligence to kind of knowing you. The funny thing is, everyone in popular culture movies has to be an individual—to be above the others, to be super. And that&#8217;s how we think of ourselves as human beings. Well what am I? I&#8217;m what&#8217;s in my brain. I have my memories, my feelings, my way of thinking of the world. And that&#8217;s who I am</p><p><i>This story originally appeared on <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/21/steve-wozniak-apple-microsoft/">Fortune.com</a>.

The Insta360 Pro camera is designed for shooting 360 films that can be viewed with virtual reality headsets. It sells for $3,500, and it&#8217;s on display at the National Association of Broadcasters event in Las Vegas this week.</p><p>The standalone camera can capture 8K 3D photos or 6K 3D videos, and it is also suitable for livestreaming. It is aimed at professional photo and video creators, as well as non-professionals who demand excellence from the camera they use to pursue their creative visions.</p><p>“The VR industry needs steady content from a strong base of creators to keep growing, but before now, high-performing cameras have been overly complicated or cost-prohibitive,” said JK Liu, founder and CEO of Insta360, in a statement. “With the Insta360 Pro, we’re giving broadcasters and creators the tool they’ve been asking for. We can’t wait to see what they come up with.”</p><p>What are consumers and professionals going to do with it? That&#8217;s a good question. Insta360 believes it will be used for live journalism and aerial photography, and its advantage is that it&#8217;s an all-in-one VR tool.</p><p>Insta360 Pro uses six independent high-definition lenses. It captures 60-megapixel 360-degree 3D stills and supports both HDR and RAW formats to bring out levels of detail and low-light performance unprecedented in a 360-degree camera of this size.</p><p>When recording 4K video, the camera supports up to 100 frames per second. In addition, the VR time-lapse mode adds a new dimension to videos, and the live preview function allows users to get the best angle before shooting.</p><p>Insta360 uses real-time image stitching technology and offers both H.264 and H.265 video compression, which substantially improves video quality at the same bit rate.</p><p>HD image files can be easily auto-stitched with Insta360 Studio. The company is enhancing the imaging potential of the camera by offering professional 3D 360-degree video that applies the 3D video-capturing capabilities of Hollywood films.</p><p>The camera can capture 3D videos in up to 6K (4K in real-time stitching mode). As a standalone camera, it can be used with the dedicated Insta360 Pro iOS and Android apps. It connects via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or 4G, and it is ready to livestream and share any event instantly on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.</p><p>Established in 2014, Shenzhen Arashi Vision Co. is a consumer technology company that goes by the name Insta360.</p><p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='341' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmBvmmBBea4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/venturebeat/SZYF/~4/TBS3iZJbJwQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/insta360-takes-preorders-for-its-8k-virtual-reality-camera-for-vr-films/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>	<post-id xmlns="com-wordpress:feed-additions:1">2220776</post-id><source url="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/insta360-takes-preorders-for-its-8k-virtual-reality-camera-for-vr-films/">Insta360 takes preorders for its 8K virtual reality camera for VR films</source>	<feedburner:origLink>https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/insta360-takes-preorders-for-its-8k-virtual-reality-camera-for-vr-films/</feedburner:origLink></item>		<item>		<title>TiEcon 2017 focuses on disruptive tech as it celebrates its 25th year</title>		<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/venturebeat/SZYF/~3/9mQvuUUbrto/</link>		<comments>https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/tiecon-2017-focuses-on-disruptive-tech-as-it-celebrates-its-25th-year/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 13:10:07 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[TiE Silicon Valley]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Dev]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Entrepreneur]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[entrepeneurship]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[entrepeneurship advice]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[startups]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[TiE Silicon Valley]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[TiEcon]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">https://venturebeat.com/?p=2219911</guid>		<description><![CDATA[<p><SPAN CLASS="POST-LABEL PARTNERED-POST">SPONSORED:</SPAN> Presented by TiE Silicon Valley TiEcon &#8212; the annual tech entrepreneurship conference created by not-for-profit TiE Silicon Valley &#8212; is approaching on May 5th &#38; 6th.
