On Tuesday, another woman came forward, alleging that O&rsquo;Reilly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-oreilly-accuser-says-he-called-her-hot-chocolate-leered-995158" target="_blank">leered at her and called her &ldquo;hot chocolate.&rdquo;</a></p><br /><p>Reagan, a 72-year-old white man, decided that he was an appropriate messenger to let women of color know that being called &ldquo;hot choclare&rdquo; by a male superior at the office isn&rsquo;t sexist, racist harassment ― it&rsquo;s merely a compliment.&nbsp;</p><br /><div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""><br /><div class="embed-code"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hot Choclare used to be a compliment on your looks today it is called sexual harassment..<a href="https://twitter.com/oreillyfactor">@oreillyfactor</a></p>&mdash; Michael Reagan (@ReaganWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReaganWorld/status/855308567242448897">April 21, 2017</a></blockquote><br /><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div><br />     <br /><p>Five minutes later, Reagan decided he had more to say ― this time, about sexual harassment writ large.</p><br /><p>&ldquo;If women are going to wear low cut dresses that show cleavage don&rsquo;t be harassed when we men look,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p><br /><div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""><br /><div class="embed-code"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If women are going to wear low cut dresses that show cleavage don&#39;t be harassed when we men look.Or shld we sue for sexual arousal?</p>&mdash; Michael Reagan (@ReaganWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReaganWorld/status/855309798669115392">April 21, 2017</a></blockquote><br /><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div><br />     <br /><p>You hear that, women?

According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm" target="_blank">sexual harassment is defined</a> as &ldquo;unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.&rdquo;</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>]]></description>      <enclosure url="http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/74_58/58fa0ae91b0000320016cc6b.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/>    </item>    <item>      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/04/21/michael-moore-recalls-the-time-bill-oreilly-accosted-him-on-the-street_n_16144116.html</guid>      <title><![CDATA[Michael Moore Recalls The Time Bill O'Reilly Accosted Him On The Street]]></title>      <author>Stephanie Marcus</author>      <link>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/04/21/michael-moore-recalls-the-time-bill-oreilly-accosted-him-on-the-street_n_16144116.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics</link>      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 10:09:26 -0400</pubDate>      <description><![CDATA[<br /><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/michael-moore" target="_blank">Michael Moore</a> is feeling pretty good after <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bill-oreilly" target="_blank">Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</a> was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-out-at-fox_us_58f67b3ee4b05b9d613e1c86" target="_blank">dumped by Fox News</a> following multiple allegations of sexual harassment.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>On Thursday, while speaking after a special screening of his 2002 film <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Columbine-Michael-Caldwell/dp/B00008DDVV" target="_blank">&ldquo;Bowling for Columbine&rdquo;</a> at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/tribeca-film-festival" target="_blank">Tribeca Film Festival,</a> the Moore recalled how O&rsquo;Reilly once randomly accosted him on the street.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Moore told the audience of one time when O&rsquo;Reilly was &ldquo;passing me by on the street in a limo, sees me, tells the driver to screech to a halt, and he jumps out of the car, yelling at me.
