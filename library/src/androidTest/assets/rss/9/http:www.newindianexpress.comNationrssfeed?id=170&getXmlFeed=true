Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act says so. It is the only option as we have found that people were getting PAN cards on fake ration cards and such PANs were used to divert fund to shell companies,&quot; the Attorney General told the bench. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>To this, the bench observed &quot;is this the remedy that you need to have Aadhaar for having PAN? Why has it been made mandatory despite this court&#39;s order?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, introduced by the Finance Act 2017, provides for mandatory quoting of Aadhaar or enrolment ID of Aadhaar application form for filing of income tax returns and for making application for allotment of PAN number with effect from July 1 this year. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Rohatgi referred to an earlier case and said they had found that SIM cards for mobile phones were procured on fake identity cards and the apex court had asked the Centre to put in place an effective mechanism to scrutinise it. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Senior counsel Arvind Datar, representing the petitioner, told the bench that they have challenged the constitutional validity of section 139AA of the income Tax Act which has made Aadhaar mandatory for applying for PAN card as well as for filing income tax returns. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&quot;As per this section, if one does not have Aadhaar card, he cannot have a PAN. This would create huge difficulties,&quot; he told the bench which said it would hear arguments on the plea on April 25. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The apex court was hearing a plea filed by CPI leader Binoy Viswam challenging constitutional validity of section 139AA of the Income Tax Act. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The apex court had on March 27 made it clear that Aadhaar cards cannot be made mandatory by the government for extending benefits of social welfare schemes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It had, however, said that Centre cannot be barred from seeking Aadhaar cards, which are issued by UIDAI, for &quot;non- benefit&quot; purposes like filing of IT returns and opening of bank accounts. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The court had also said that a constitution bench was needed to be constituted to authoritatively decide on a batch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar scheme on grounds including that it infringes on the Right to Privacy of citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The apex court on August 11, 2015 had said Aadhaar cards will not be mandatory for availing benefits of government&#39;s welfare schemes and barred the authorities from sharing personal biometric data collected for enrollment under the scheme. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, on October 15, 2015 it had lifted its earlier restriction and permitted the voluntary use of Aadhaar cards in welfare schemes that also included MGNREGA, all pension schemes and the provident fund besides ambitious flagship programmes like &#39;Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna&#39; of the NDA government.&nbsp;</p>]]></story><tags>Supreme Court, centre,  mandatory,  Aadhaar card,  optional</tags><image>http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/4/21/w600X390/aadhar-woman_EPS.jpg</image><imagecaption>Image used for representational purpose.</imagecaption><link>http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/apr/21/supreme-court-to-centre-how-can-you-make-aadhaar-mandatory-for-pan-when-we-have-passed-an-order-to-1596153.html</link></item><item><id>1596223</id><Pcategory>Nation</Pcategory><category></category> <title>Indian Navy&amp;#39;s land variant of long range BrahMos cruise missile bang on target during maiden trial from warship</title><author>Hemant Kumar Rout</author><source>Express News Service</source><pubDate>Friday, April 21, 2017 07:50 PM +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[The land-attack version of BrahMos has been operationalised in the Indian Army since 2007.]]></description><story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">BHUBANESWAR: The Indian Navy conducted maiden test-firing of the land attack variant of the long range supersonic cruise missile BrahMos from a warship on Friday, demonstrating the weapon&rsquo;s operational capability. The missile followed the coordinated flight path perfectly and was on target.</p><p>Though the previous land attack version of the missile, with a strike range of 299 km has been operationalised in the Army since 2007, it was the first time that the Navy tested the missile after its range was extended.</p><p>Defence sources said, that with an extended range, the nuclear capable missile BrahMos, was fired from a guided missile- frigate Teg, on a target on land. The strike range of the missile was extended from 299 km to 450 km recently after<br />India became a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).</p><p>&ldquo;The test conducted as part of an experimental trial was successful and met all mission parameters. The most lethal and potent weapon system for precision strike has proved its effectiveness once again,&rdquo; said a defence official from New<br />Delhi.</p><p>Post the MTCR membership, the long range missile was first test-launched from a mobile autonomous launcher (MAL) deployed in full operational configuration at Chandipur-based launching complex&ndash;III of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) on March 11.</p><p>However, the successful maiden firing of the BrahMos land attack variant has significantly enhanced the prowess of the Indian Navy and has placed the country in the club of select five nations.</p><p>This fire-and-forget missile has the capability to take on surface-based targets by flying a combined high-low trajectory, thus evading enemy air defence systems.</p><p>The BrahMos missile was jointly developed by India and Russia. Its anti ship variant has already been inducted in the Navy. A majority of the Navy&rsquo;s frontline classes of ships like the Kolkata, Ranvir and Teg are capable of firing this missile.</p><p>&ldquo;The land attack variant of BrahMos missile provides naval ships the capability to precisely neutralise selected targets deep inland, far away from the coast and from stand-off ranges at sea,&rdquo; the official added.</p><p>The BrahMos missile, which derives its name from the Brahmaputra and Moskova rivers, was developed by an Indo-Russian joint venture after the two countries signed an agreement in February 1998.</p><p>The missile flies at a speed of Mach 2.8 and is capable of being launched from land, sea, submarine and air against targets on land and sea.</p><p>It can carry a conventional warhead of 200 to 300 kg, thus delivering with high-precision, devastating power at supersonic speed.</p>]]></story><tags>Indian Navy, BrahMos supersonic cruise missile</tags><image>http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/4/21/w600X390/BrahMos4.JPG</image><imagecaption>File photo for representational purpose</imagecaption><link>http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/apr/21/indian-navys-land-variant-of-long-range-brahmos-cruise-missile-bang-on-target-during-maiden-trial-f-1596223.html</link></item><item><id>1596252</id><Pcategory>Nation</Pcategory><category></category> <title>Water storage in southern states less than last 10 years</title><author>Express News Service</author><source>Express News Service</source><pubDate>Friday, April 21, 2017 07:47 PM +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[The Southern having 31 reservoirs under Central Water Commission monitoring total storage of 5.61 Billion Cubic Metre which is 11 percent of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs.]]></description><story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: As temperature soars across India, water level storage in country&rsquo;s 91 reservoirs fell to 29 percent of total storage, indicating possible drinking water shortage in months to come.

Under the project, there are going to be three multi-modal terminals--one each at Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), Sahibganj (Jharkhand), and Haldia (West Bengal). &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the project will enable the Centre setting up of River Information Service System on NW -1 for the first time in India. River Information System (RIS) are equipment, hardware and software information technology (IT) related services designed to optimize traffic and transport processes in inland navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rail and Road corridors in this region are heavily saturated. Hence, the development of NW-1 would provide an alternative, viable, economical, efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport. The waterway will act as a catalyst in the socio-economic development of the regions by creating new business and employment opportunities.</p>]]></story><tags></tags><image>http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2016/11/10/w600X390/World-BankHQ.jpg</image><imagecaption>A view of the World Bank headquarters building in Washington.
