It’s a grave and it’s a serious one,” said Beileh.The 2011 drought killed an estimated 260,000 people.&#160;The minister said the international community is responding to the call to help drought-affected populations avert famine.&#160;“I pray to God that famine does not come,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s a sad story. I think the assistance that we are getting from around the world is such that famine can be avoided.”&#160;</description>            <link>http://www.voanews.com/a/congressman-senator-say-aid-cuts-in-somalia/3819964.html</link>             <guid>http://www.voanews.com/a/congressman-senator-say-aid-cuts-in-somalia/3819964.html</guid>                        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 10:02:18 -0400</pubDate>            <category>USA</category><category>Africa</category><author>webdesk@voanews.com (Abdulaziz Osman, Abdi H.

Like many urban waterways, the river is being restored to its natural state, and volunteers are helping for three weekends in April in an annual cleanup. The sprucing up coincides with Earth Day, April 22.Much of the river was lined with concrete after devastating floods in 1938, and today the channel is filled with rainwater in winter but is often dry in summer. When barren, the riverbed has been featured in Hollywood movies such as the 1978 musical Grease, where it was the scene of a teenage auto drag race.Increasingly, however, stretches of greenery have re-emerged amid the concrete, drawing birds, other wildlife and human visitors.“Being exposed to this natural section where there’s wildlife, and quite a bit of trash as well ... it’s really eye-opening and shocking for a lot of people,” said Stephen Mejia of the nonprofit group Friends of the Los Angeles River. He was sorting through trash collected by volunteers on a recent weekend.This season’s winter flooding brought tons of trash, and volunteers from clubs, businesses and industry groups are helping remove it.Lauren Scott of the American Chemistry Council, an industry group whose members produce some of the plastic debris that finds its way into the river, is helping sort the trash to determine its composition and origin, and ultimately, she told VOA, “to help prevent the litter.”Local restrictions on plastic bags and recycling programs are helping, but the annual cleanup is still needed, said Scott, after this year’s heavy rains and “because everyone wants a clean river that we can swim and boat and hike in.”Nine-time Paralympic athlete Candace Cable, a member of the committee to bring the Olympic Games to Los Angeles, is helping with the cleanup by collecting trash from her wheelchair. She says the volunteer-run program to bring the Summer Games to the city in 2024 hopes to “get future volunteers for the Games” as its promoters help to beautify the city.Los Angeles is competing for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games against the sole remaining rival, Paris.A volunteer named Tom pulls a blanket from the thick underbrush and says he is helping Los Angeles recover its natural beauty.“We’ve got beautiful places,” he said, “but as you can see, with the trash they become not so beautiful, so I’m just glad to do what I can to help change that.”Urban waterways play a vital role in a region’s ecology, said Christine Lee, a science applications engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Lee studies water quality, using data from earth-observing satellites and airborne monitors, focusing in part on another waterway, the San Francisco Bay Delta. It is home to endangered species and is a crucial source of water for California farmers. Debates over its role have put agricultural and environmental groups at odds.Watch: Volunteers Work to Revitalize Los Angeles RiverIn Los Angeles, officials must weigh the need for flood control with the requirements of the natural ecosystem, where wetlands fed by the Los Angeles River purify and recharge the groundwater.The annual cleanup and other efforts to revitalize the river are showing results, as residents take advantage of bike paths and jogging trails along the river’s meandering route.Taking a break from collecting trash, teacher Lois Keller told VOA, “It’s been really exciting to start to see the river come back.”&#160;</description>            <link>http://www.voanews.com/a/volunteers-work-to-revitalize-los-angeles-river/3819669.html</link>             <guid>http://www.voanews.com/a/volunteers-work-to-revitalize-los-angeles-river/3819669.html</guid>                        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:33:09 -0400</pubDate>            <category>USA</category><author>webdesk@voanews.com (Mike O&#39;Sullivan)</author><comments>http://www.voanews.com/a/volunteers-work-to-revitalize-los-angeles-river/3819669.html#relatedInfoContainer</comments><enclosure url="https://gdb.voanews.com/5D74641C-0798-496A-93A2-C4252D9A7921_w800_h450.jpg" length="3123" type="image/jpeg"/>        </item>		        <item>            <title>Arkansas Executes First Inmate in a Dozen Years</title>            <description>Arkansas has executed an inmate for the first time in nearly a dozen years as part of its plan to execute several inmates before a drug expires April 30, despite court rulings that have already spared three men.&#160;Ledell Lee’s execution was the first in the state since 2005. He was pronounced dead at 11:56 p.m. Thursday, four minutes before his death warrant was to expire.&#160;Lee, 51, was put on death row for the 1993 death of his neighbor Debra Reese, whom Lee struck 36 times with a tire tool her husband had given her for protection. Lee was arrested less than an hour after the killing after spending some of the $300 he had stolen from Reese.&#160;More executions plannedTwo more inmates are set to die Monday, and one on April 27. Another inmate scheduled for execution next week has received a stay.&#160;The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Ledell Lee’s execution, rejecting a round of last-minute appeals the condemned inmate’s attorneys filed. An earlier ruling from the state Supreme Court allowing officials to use a lethal-injection drug that a supplier says was obtained by misleading the company cleared the way for Lee’s execution.&#160;&#160;Arkansas dropped plans to execute a second inmate, Stacey Johnson, on the same day after the state Supreme Court said it wouldn’t reconsider his stay, which was issued so Johnson could seek more DNA tests in hopes of proving his innocence.&#160;The state originally set four double executions over an 11-day period in April. The eight executions would have been the most by a state in such a compressed period since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state says the executions need to be carried out before its supply of one lethal injection drug, midazolam, expires April 30. Three executions were canceled because of court decisions, and legal rulings have put at least one of the other five in doubt.&#160;Justices on Thursday reversed an order by Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray that halted the use of vecuronium bromide, one of three drugs used in the state’s lethal-injection process, in any execution. McKesson Corp. says the state obtained the drug under false pretenses and that it wants nothing to do with executions.&#160;McKesson said it was disappointed in the court’s ruling.&#160;“We believe we have done all we can do at this time to recover our product,” the company said in a statement.&#160;Justices also denied an attempt by makers of midazolam and potassium chloride — the two other drugs in Arkansas’ execution plan — to intervene in McKesson’s fight over the vecuronium bromide. The pharmaceutical companies say there is a public health risk if their drugs are diverted for use in executions, and that the state’s possession of the drugs violates rules within their distribution networks.Governor frustrated&#160;The legal maneuvers frustrated Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who had set the execution schedule less than two months ago. The state’s elected prosecutors also criticized the roadblocks to the execution plans.&#160;“Through the manipulation of the judicial system, these men continue to torment the victims’ families in seeking, by any means, to avoid their just punishment,” the prosecutors said in a joint statement issued Thursday.&#160;Lawyers for the state have complained that the inmates are filing court papers just to run out the clock on Arkansas’ midazolam supply. Prisons director Wendy Kelley has said the state has no way to obtain more midazolam or vecuronium bromide.&#160;Earlier in the evening, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on a previous batch of appeals with new justice Neil Gorsuch voting with the majority of five to deny the stay of execution sought by Lee and the other inmates. Justice Stephen Breyer said in a dissent he was troubled by Arkansas’ push to execute the inmates before its supply of midazolam expires.&#160;“Apparently the reason the state decided to proceed with these eight executions is that the ‘use by’ date of the state’s execution drug is about to expire. ... In my view, that factor, when considered as a determining factor separating those who live from those who die, is close to random,” Breyer wrote.&#160;</description>            <link>http://www.voanews.com/a/arkansas-executes-inmate/3819703.html</link>             <guid>http://www.voanews.com/a/arkansas-executes-inmate/3819703.html</guid>                        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:07:57 -0400</pubDate>            <category>USA</category><category>US Politics</category><author>webdesk@voanews.com (Associated Press)</author><enclosure url="https://gdb.voanews.com/F9A45266-CDA1-4272-9E61-9B7D5E80A372_cx0_cy3_cw0_w800_h450.jpg" length="3123" type="image/jpeg"/>        </item>		        <item>            <title>Volunteers Work to Revitalize Los Angeles River</title>            <description>The Los Angeles River runs for 80 kilometers through the sprawling city of Los Angeles.

She and her husband had established a foundation to aid street children in 2013, but were arrested along with several others in 2014.&#160;Her case was on the agenda when President Donald Trump met earlier this month with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.&#160;Details of their arrival were first reported by The Washington Post. Their release and the freedom of four other humanitarian workers were negotiated by Trump and White House aides, and Trump sent a U.S. government aircraft to Cairo to bring them home, the Post reported.&#160;Hijazi, a dual national, was born in Egypt and grew up in Falls Church, Virginia, a Washington suburb. She received a degree in conflict resolution from George Mason University in 2009.&#160;</description>            <link>http://www.voanews.com/a/charity-worker-freed-in-egypt-retuns-to-us/3819689.html</link>             <guid>http://www.voanews.com/a/charity-worker-freed-in-egypt-retuns-to-us/3819689.html</guid>                        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 23:43:44 -0400</pubDate>            <category>Middle East</category><category>USA</category><author>webdesk@voanews.com (Associated Press)</author><enclosure url="https://gdb.voanews.com/354B100D-E6E9-418F-BA94-29C52FF36A8C_w800_h450.jpg" length="3123" type="image/jpeg"/>        </item>       </channel></rss>
