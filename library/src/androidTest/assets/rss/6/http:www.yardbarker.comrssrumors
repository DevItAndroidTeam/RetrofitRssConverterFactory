The bombing took place before the April 11 Champions League match against Monaco, which was subsequently moved to the following night. Defender Marc Bartra was the only player injured, and he is recovering from surgery for a broken wrist.

The Pacers are down 0-2 in the first round of the playoffs, but it appears they are starting to come alive at home. They&#8217;re up 74-49 at halftime against Cleveland.</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 20:45:14 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/watch_myles_turner_destroys_tristan_thompson_with_vicious_slam_in_game_3/s1_12740_23768071</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/watch_myles_turner_destroys_tristan_thompson_with_vicious_slam_in_game_3/s1_12740_23768071</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>WATCH: Myles Turner destroys Tristan Thompson with vicious slam in Game 3</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/watch_myles_turner_destroys_tristan_thompson_with_vicious_slam_in_game_3/s1_12740_23768071</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/a/f/af3d90d613610eb20d9f4938b1abfd9bb133f8c4/top_story/10022428.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Eli Manning angrily denies fake memorabilia allegations</title>      <description>Eli Manning spoke with reporters on Thursday about the ongoing memorabilia scandal within the New York Giants organization, and the quarterback vehemently denied taking part in any wrongdoing.Manning, who is part of a lawsuit from memorabilia dealers who claim he participated in a fraud scheme, assured reporters he did nothing illegal and said he is being &#8220;attacked.&#8221; Manning said the accusations have been floating around for years and that he is confident he will be completely exonerated when all the facts come out.The civil-racketeering lawsuit against the Giants dates back to Manning&#8217;s rookie year in 2004. An email Manning sent to an equipment manager in 2010 is supposedly considered a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; in the case. You can read the text of the email here.Earlier in the week, Brandon Steiner of sports memorabilia juggernaut Steiner Sports said in a Facebook live segment that he does not believe Manning would provide anyone with fake gear passed off as game-used.</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 12:40:12 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/eli_manning_angrily_denies_taking_part_in_memorabilia_scandal/s1_127_23763802</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/eli_manning_angrily_denies_taking_part_in_memorabilia_scandal/s1_127_23763802</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Eli Manning angrily denies fake memorabilia allegations</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/eli_manning_angrily_denies_taking_part_in_memorabilia_scandal/s1_127_23763802</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/a/0/a003481bb50940cd8965cb89df7a128d5e361500/top_story/9823937.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Aaron Hernandez suicide notes found in cell</title>      <description>There have been many questions surrounding the death of Aaron Hernandez, including whether or not he committed suicide.The Worcester (Mass.) County District Attorney&#8217;s office has officially ruled Hernandez&#8217;s death a suicide. The coroner who examined the former Patriots tight end says the manner of death was suicide and the cause of death was asphyxia by hanging.In a press release, the district attorney&#8217;s office also says Hernandez&#8217;s cell had cardboard in the tracks of the door to try and impede entry.Three notes were found next to a bible in the cell, according to the release. A previous detail said Hernandez had a bible verse written on his forehead.Hernandez was found hanging from a bed sheet in his cell shortly after 3 a.m. Wednesday morning and was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead an hour later. He was serving life in prison for the murder of Odin Lloyd.</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 18:49:13 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/aaron_hernandez_suicide_notes_found_in_cell/s1_127_23766049</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/aaron_hernandez_suicide_notes_found_in_cell/s1_127_23766049</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Aaron Hernandez suicide notes found in cell</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/aaron_hernandez_suicide_notes_found_in_cell/s1_127_23766049</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/b/e/be2cf187b1dabc9dc5bfb8184adac1232401bf24/top_story/10020089.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Reuben Foster failed drug test at combine due to diluted sample</title>      <description>Nothing seems to be going right for Reuben Foster in the pre-draft process.The former Alabama linebacker informed NFL Media&#8217;s Ian Rapoport that he failed a drug test at the combine. Rapoport reported the story on Thursday, and got Foster&#8217;s side of things. Foster&#8217;s test came back as positive because it was flagged as a diluted sample, which counts as a failed test.Foster is adamant that he is clean and has a good explanation for why the sample was diluted.Rapoport says Foster told him he was sick before the NFL Combine and was throwing up, had diarrhea and cramping, so a doctor suggested using an IV to hydrate. Foster, who believes he was ill due to food poisoning, began hydrating himself.&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t eat much, but I had to drink water and Gatorade,&#8221; Foster told Rapoport. &#8220;Then a few coaches said something about me being too light. And I&#8217;m a coach-pleaser. I don&#8217;t care what everybody thinks, but I care what coaches think. So I drank and ate as much as I could without throwing up.

But there&#8217;s a difference between extensive preparation and wasting time. On Thursday, the Patriots held a private workout with former UConn defensive back Obi Melifonwu. After he blew scouts away at the NFL Combine last month, Melifonwu is expected to be drafted somewhere in the late-first or early-second round.At the moment, New England doesn&#8217;t have a pick until the third round (72nd overall). Teams are only allowed to hold private visits with 30 players before the draft, and the Patriots have hosted top talents like Melifonwu, Florida defensive back Teez Tarbor and Wisconsin offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk. As Ryan Hannable of WEEI.com notes, Ramczyk is considered one of the best offensive linemen i</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 15:57:50 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/patriots_operating_as_if_they_will_trade_jimmy_garoppolo_or_malcolm_butler/s1_127_23765299</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/patriots_operating_as_if_they_will_trade_jimmy_garoppolo_or_malcolm_butler/s1_127_23765299</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Patriots operating as if they will trade Garoppolo or Butler?</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/patriots_operating_as_if_they_will_trade_jimmy_garoppolo_or_malcolm_butler/s1_127_23765299</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/6/7/672d438e4e28df86f3b5f847a1851ab51ff64f8b/top_story/9865661.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Browns reportedly willing to eat $10M in Brock Osweiler trade</title>      <description>Despite what they are saying publicly, the Cleveland Browns would still prefer to unload Brock Osweiler at some point this offseason. In fact, they may even pay another team to take the quarterback off their hands.Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports reports that the Browns are willing to eat $10 million of the $16 million in guaranteed money Osweiler is owed in 2017 if a team wants to trade for him. The timing of the report is interesting, considering it comes just one day after Browns general manager Sashi Brown said Osweiler will be given an opportunity to compete for a starting job. Of course, Osweiler&#8217;s trade value is low enough as is, so Cleveland is trying to avoid sounding desperate.By trading for Osweiler, the Browns essentially bought a 2018 second-round pick off of the Houston Texans for $16 million. Any money they can get knocked off of that total is a bonus, and it is highly unlikely a team is going to pay the price they are reportedly seeking in a trade.

However, Dimitroff wouldn&#8217;t commit to Mixon specifically still being on the team&#8217;s draft board, per Alex Glaze of 11Alive. The defending NFC champion Falcons have a pick at the end of the first round (where we&#8217;ve heard whispers that Mixon may actually be in play) as well as at the end of the second.&#160;While Dimitroff&#8217;s statement may just be a general one about keeping an open mind heading into the draft, Atlanta does have starting running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman coming off their team-friendly deals fairly soon. As such, it&#8217;s at least notable that they are more receptive to those players with character issues than some other teams are.</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 14:06:38 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/falcons_gm_open_to_drafting_red_flagged_prospects_were_not_looking_for_angels/s1_127_23764153</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/falcons_gm_open_to_drafting_red_flagged_prospects_were_not_looking_for_angels/s1_127_23764153</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Falcons GM on drafting red-flagged prospects: &#8216;We&#8217;re not looking for angels&#8217;</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/falcons_gm_open_to_drafting_red_flagged_prospects_were_not_looking_for_angels/s1_127_23764153</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/6/8/6864b67569a21b5193eedbea159882d78cd1c074/top_story/9810478.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Expert: Extent of child brain injuries from football &#8216;took my breath away&#8217;</title>      <description>Parents who allow their&#160;children to&#160;play tackle football might want to reconsider their choice after reading what top concussion experts have to say on the subject.Chris Nowinski, co-founder and executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, and Dr. Ann McKee, director of the Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center at Boston University, appeared on the latest episode of HBO&#8217;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.&quot;Speaking with&#160;HBO&#8217;s Bernard Goldberg, they gave a glimpse into research they&#8217;ve been conducting on the brains of children who play tackle football.&#8220;I&#8217;ve looked at brains of young teenagers and seen damage that I&#8217;ve never seen before,&#8221; McKee said, per to Lindsay Gibbs of Think Progress. &#8220;And it came from football impact injuries.

Raveling, a former college basketball coach who is now Nike&#8217;s Global Basketball Sports Marketing Director, was obviously exaggerating a bit. In any event, his comment gives us an idea of how people in the sports apparel world feel about Ball.Ball, who has started his own company called the Big Baller Brand, has infamously said that he believes his three sons &#8212; UCLA star Lonzo and high schoolers LiAngelo and LaMelo &#8212; can land a $1 billion shoe contract.

This year&#8217;s draft class is considered very deep at the running back position, which is not helping guys like Peterson and Blount. Both are on the wrong side of 30, and teams would rather wait to see if they can address the position in the draft.Blount&#8217;s days with the Patriots seem to be over, assuming the Bills don&#8217;t match New England&#8217;s offer sheet to Mike Gillislee. Peterson has been linked to one other team in recent days, but that team also seems content to wait until after the draft. Patience seems like the only option for guys like Peterson and Blount.</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 12:22:58 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/report_giants_have_interest_in_adrian_peterson_legarrette_blount/s1_127_23763643</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/report_giants_have_interest_in_adrian_peterson_legarrette_blount/s1_127_23763643</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Report: Giants have interest in Peterson, Blount</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/report_giants_have_interest_in_adrian_peterson_legarrette_blount/s1_127_23763643</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/9/b/9ba43fd9a1998afd49d0ab5acae0157703212edd/top_story/10000072.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Jim Harbaugh lauds Colin Kaepernick in Time&#8217;s &#8216;The 100 Most Influential People&#8217;</title>      <description>Time magazine featured Colin Kaepernick in its &#8220;The Most 100 Influential People,&#8221; and Jim Harbaugh penned the passage highlighting why he earned that spot.Harbaugh and Kaepernick were tied at the hip during their tenures with the San Francisco 49ers. The coach was the main reason the 49ers drafted the former Nevada star, and he helped craft Kaepernick into one of the NFL&#8217;s most dangerous offensive weapons before the wheels came off in San Francisco and Harbaugh was jettisoned from the organization.The current Michigan coach has come to Kaepernick&#8217;s defense on numerous occasions when other have criticized his former pupil. His loyalty can also be seen in the passage he wrote for Time about Kaepernick.&#8220;Colin Kaepernick was alone in his early protests last year when he boldly and courageously confronted perceived inequalities in our social-justice system by refusing to stand for the national anthem,&#8221; Harbaugh wrote. &#8220;At times in our nation&#8217;s history, we have been all too quick to judge and oppos</description>      <pubDate>20 Apr 2017 12:08:24 -0400</pubDate>      <link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/jim_harbaugh_lauds_colin_kaepernick_in_times_the_100_most_influential_people_passage/s1_12680_23762746</link>      <guid>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/jim_harbaugh_lauds_colin_kaepernick_in_times_the_100_most_influential_people_passage/s1_12680_23762746</guid>      <yb:image>        <yb:title>Jim Harbaugh lauds Colin Kaepernick in Time&#8217;s &#8216;The 100 Most Influential People&#8217;</yb:title>        <yb:link>http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/jim_harbaugh_lauds_colin_kaepernick_in_times_the_100_most_influential_people_passage/s1_12680_23762746</yb:link>        <yb:url>http://www.yardbarker.com/media/3/a/3a4d3ee51fd02303a69459196b38fe715f42db99/top_story/GettyImages-460874744.jpg</yb:url>      </yb:image>    </item>    <item>      <title>Six most underrated stars in NBA playoffs so far</title>      <description>If you haven&#8217;t been watching the NBA playoffs, you&#8217;re missing out.The first round has been crazy so far.
